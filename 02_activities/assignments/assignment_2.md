# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    #### Good Visualization:

    https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jrcopreros/viz/TorontoCityandColour/Final

    City and Colour: Income Inequality in Toronto (#VOTD) by JR Copreros

    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      This data visualization would be classified as GOOD because it is very intuitative and informative at first glance. 
      Upon further inspection of the visualization, we can see that the informative provided is reproducible and accurate according to the data source used (Census 2016).
      It also directly answers the question for those interested: Average income based on neighborhoods and race. (Would be relevant for discussions on income inequality and visible minorities).
      Another great feature of this visualization is that it effectively shows the spatial relationships and patterns across different Toronto neighborhoods.
      Interactive elements help keep the reader engaged.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      This visualization could be improved through several methods:
        -updating the data source
            -instead of using the 2016 Population Census, use the more updated recent 2021 census available (even though a lot has changed since 2021 and now)
        -increase accessibility through better colour selection/contrast
            -large fonts and alternative text descriptions
        -non-technical users may not be used to interactive maps and may not know how to navigate it
        -it is resource intensive, loading the data visualization requires significant processing for the interactive elements
      
      ```

    #### Bad Visualization:

    https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/messidude/viz/LosAngelesCounty-KoreanBBQComparison/Dashboard1

    Los Angeles County- Korean BBQ Comparison by Rajesh

    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      The creator has classified local Korean barbeque restaurants in the Los Angeles area in four categories:
                1. More expensive than average and not as tasty
                2. More expensive than average but tasty
                3. Cheaper than average but not as tasty
                4. Cheaper than average but tastier

      While the idea behind this data visualization is interesting, it would be classified as BAD for several reasons:
            -visual overload
                -overwhelming at first glance
                -unclear why colour scheme was used for data points
                -dark background makes it difficult to read in contrast with the multiple data points
            -search bar obstructs data points when in use
            -inconsistent use of symbols
                -unclear why usage of both circles and triangles to represent data points
            -misleading due to lack of context, (how are the metrics for cost and average ratings calculated)
            -accessibility
                -since it relies heavily on the colours (red, yellow, orange), it can pose some challenges for certain users
            -data source
                -unclear where the data is being sourced form (is it reproducible?, since no data source is cited)
                -questions about reliability and accuracy

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
        This data visualization could be improved by:
            -Improved accessibility
                -using colour palettes that are more accessible to colourblind users
                -increased font size for data points
                -change background colour
            -Improved context and data source
                -provide data source, and information on how metrics for ratings and costs were calculated
                    -overall being more transparent and reproducibile
          
      ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
