Fire Incidents

### Distribution of Fire Incidents in Toronto:

### For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    Excel (data queries by SQL)
    > Who is your intended audience? 
    -Fire Departments and Safety Teams  
    -City of Toronto Policy Teams for Urban Planning and Safety

    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    The visualization is conveying the distribution of fire types in Toronto with the goal of emphasizing where resources may need to be allocated.

    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
    Substantive:  
    -Clear categories (Fire, No Loss Outdoor Fire, Explosion), while informative

    Perceptual:  
    -Included data labels with exact counts to avoid miscommunication

    Aesthetic:  
    -Clean layout with readable fonts
    -Title and axis labels are descriptive and to the point

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    I included the raw data source, SQL queries, and the processed data in my data folder (05_src). If Excel is not available, it still could be easily reproduced in Python.


    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    I ensured the text and visualization has clear font sizes and use a colourblind-friendly schema (blue). I also included data labels for precise counts and kept the overall graph simple. 

    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    This visualization is useful for fire safety teams, the city of Toronto government, and the general public.
    For fire safety teams - allocate resources based on fire type
    For the City of Toronto - urban planning and emergency preparedness of resources
    For general public - raise awareness of fire risks and the types

    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    For this visualization, it was primarily done with SQL Querying, and exporting the data to Excel for visualization. From there, I completed the visualization with best practices.
